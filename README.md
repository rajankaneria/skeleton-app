#Zend Framework 2 and Doctrine 2

The idea of this skeleton is so that we can develop without having to do much manual installation work.
When starting a new project we spend a lot of our time configuring and installing.
Here the aim is to reduce the pain and to get on with what we need to do.

This is a Skeleton Application with Doctrine 2 ready to use along with the following:

- NodeJS
- Bower
- Grunt
- Bootstrap
- A ready to use User entity
- ModelInterface

The configuration file for Doctrine2 is stored in: config/autoload/global.php

There are some pre-defined Grunt tasks ready to use straight away:

1. grunt composer_update
2. grunt update_schema
3. grunt validate_schema
4. grunt orm_info

All language files are stored in the Common module.

##Instructions
To get started, simply run: 'sh installation.sh'

Please note: ensure you have 'npm' as an alias for NodeJS components.

This installation is aimed at Linux/Mac OSX platforms.
